      <h2>The Brief Overview</h2>
      <p>Weather describes short-term conditions in the atmosphere (for example: rain, sunshine, wind, snow) that happen over hours to weeks in a specific place. Climate describes the long-term average of weather patterns in a region, typically observed over 30 years or more.</p>
      <p>Scientists use many measurements — like temperature, precipitation, and sea level — collected by satellites and ground stations to understand how Earth’s climate is changing. Recent observations show a warming trend that affects ecosystems, weather extremes, and sea level.</p>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Weather = short-term atmospheric conditions.</li>
        <li>Climate = long-term average of weather patterns.</li>
        <li>Measurements from satellites help track changes over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About the Atmosphere</h2>
      <p>The atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds Earth. It protects life by keeping the planet warm, supplying oxygen, and shaping weather. Tiny changes in atmospheric composition — such as increases in greenhouse gases — can affect global temperatures and weather patterns.</p>
      <h3>Topics covered</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The greenhouse effect and how certain gases trap heat.</li>
        <li>Air pollution sources and their effects on health and climate.</li>
        <li>How scientists monitor the atmosphere from space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Water on Earth</h2>
      <p>Water covers most of Earth’s surface and moves between the oceans, atmosphere, land, and living things. NASA observes oceans, ice, rivers, and clouds to learn how water cycles and how changes — like melting ice or shifting rainfall — affect people and ecosystems.</p>
      <h3>Key ideas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ocean and ice changes influence sea level and coastal communities.</li>
        <li>Precipitation patterns affect water supplies and agriculture.</li>
        <li>Satellites help scientists measure water across the planet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Energy and Climate</h2>
      <p>Energy from the Sun drives Earth’s weather and climate. Human activities that produce energy (such as burning fossil fuels) release greenhouse gases that change the climate. Learning about energy sources and choices helps students understand impacts on air quality and temperature.</p>
      <h3>Practical points</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Renewable energy (like solar and wind) emits far less CO₂ than fossil fuels.</li>
        <li>Energy efficiency (LEDs, managing devices) reduces consumption and emissions.</li>
        <li>Everyday choices — transport, electricity use — influence emissions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Plants, Animals, and Climate</h2>
      <p>Plants and animals respond to climate. Satellites can monitor vegetation health, habitats, and events such as coral bleaching. Observations help scientists track ecosystem changes and support conservation efforts.</p>
      <h3>Why it matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Changes in temperature and precipitation affect species ranges and growing seasons.</li>
        <li>Satellite data helps detect stress in ecosystems early.</li>
        <li>Students can learn about local and global impacts through simple observations and activities.</li>
      </ul>
